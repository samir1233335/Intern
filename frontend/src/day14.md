// props are used ot pass data from parent components to child components // in props only parent to child send the data

// props are read only

//App.jsx // students.jsx // users.jsx // teacher .jsx

//state is a built-in react object used to store data that can chnage over time . when the state changes , react automatically updates the user interface(ui) // hooks is a special react function that lets function components use react features sucha as : useState, useEffect , useContext, useMemo etc // const [value,setVlaue]=usestate(0) /// ///class App extends React.Component{

////}/////

// props vs state //props vs state //props are data passed from a parent to child component | state is data that is managed within a component when state changes, the component re-renders // props are immutable -- it can not be changed by the child || state are mutable - it can change over time // does not trigger re-render by itslef || state updates may trigger re-render of the component // used for passing data from paretn to child components || used of local data that change in the component

/// why do we use hooks // 1 useState and othes many React features able to used in functional components // 2 simpler code // 3 re-useful logic // 4 easier testing

/// 1 useState in React

//const[count,setCount]=useState(0) // it is a React Hook that lets us to add state state to functional component it returns a state variable and a function to update that state

// how its works // initailize the state useState() 0 //update the state using the setState/setCount() 1 // components re-renders with new state 1

/// useEffect

it is a react hook that let us perform side effects in functional components types of the useeffect
1//not dependencies array runs after every render (mounted and updated) useEffect(()={

}); 2// empty dependencies array [] runs only once after the component is mounted // useEffect()=>{

},[];

3 with dependencies array[deps] runs when the specified dependencies changes

// usecases of the useEffect

1 fetching data from apis 2 updating the document title or meta data 3 controllig timers (settimeout/setinterval())

// Component Lifecycle Birth-life-Death Mount(create)-update-Hide(Removed) it is the series of the stage that a react component goes through from the time it is created until it is removed from the screen. 1 Mounting Mounting is when a component is created and displayed on the screen for the first time example function App(){ return (

hello React
) }
2 updating it is the phase updating happens whenever state changes , props change and context changes

3 unmounting it means the component is removed from the screeen

// Api fetching What is API?

//useContext it hepls to share data between components without passing props manually through every level or components (avoids "props drilling")

App(usrname="samir") Navbar() Menu() Profiel()

with contenxt App----> Context ------> Any components Any component can access the shared data directly

step 1 create user context step 2 create provider for avalibale the data inside step 3 creating consumer to consume the data

//useMemo //useRef
